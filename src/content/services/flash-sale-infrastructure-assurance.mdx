## The Six-Figure Problem

Every year, e-commerce businesses lose millions during their most critical sales events.

The pattern is relentlessly predictable:
- Your marketing team spends months planning the perfect flash sale
- Your paid ads drive unprecedented traffic to your site
- And then... your infrastructure buckles under the load

The result? Abandoned carts. Lost revenue. Damaged brand reputation.

For every minute your site is slow or down during a flash sale, you lose an average of $5,000-$15,000 in direct revenue — turning what should be your most profitable moment into a technical catastrophe that leaves both customers and executives frustrated.
